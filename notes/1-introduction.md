# Overview

RL: Learning through **experience/data** to make good decisions under **uncertainty**.

RL generally involves the following components:
- Optimization: find an optimal way to make decisions
- Delayed consequences: decition may impact things much later, hence introduce two challenges:
  - when planning: need to consider not only immediate consequences but also future consequences
  - when learning: temporal credit assignment is difficult
- Exploration: learn about the world by making decisions and observing the outcomes
- Generalization: learn from limited data to make good decisions in the future

Two problem categories where RL is particularly useful:
- No examples of desired behavior: like we want to go beyond human performance
- Enormous search or optimalization problem with delayed outcomes
